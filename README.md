# logs-search
Search logs.tf for games common to two players

## Usage:
Find the [logs.tf](logs.tf) profiles of the players in question. When prompted, enter the urls. Note: the resulting list of logs is currently limited to the most recent 1000 games of __both__ players.

## Future Plans
    * web interface
    * searches using any reasonable number of users
    * search using multiple types of steam identifiers
